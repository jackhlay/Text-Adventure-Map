# On hiatus from this project for now
- Due to gamebreaking bugs beyond my ability to solve I have stopped working on this for now. Maybe I will comeback, and make a work around. For now though ðŸ«¡
- I am working on a text adventure in C as a way to learn the language better, ![Check it out here if you want.(Link soon)]()
  
  
  
# Text adventure Dungeon Crawler  
![8 bit image of a green flame](/src/icon.png)  
## This is a text aventure game that uses procedural generation to create the map and different floors.
## It includes a secondary screen to show the map as the player progresses through the dungeon, and to view and interact with the inventory.

## Inventory Screen Example:
